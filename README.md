Project Nyx is a privacy first cybersecurity framework built to make digital security simple, accessible, and free for everyone. Designed for users of all experience levels, Nyx combines strong encryption, ease-of-use, and transparency to give you complete control over your data.

Aegis, the first application under Project Nyx, is a fully encrypted, offline password manager that generates and stores strong passwords for all your accounts.

Our Goals

Accessibility: Cybersecurity should not require technical expertise. Nyx is simple for non-tech-savvy users while remaining powerful for developers.

Privacy & Control: Everything is encrypted locally. Even the developers cannot access your data.

Free & Open Source: No paywalls, no hidden costs, no surveillance. Transparency is core to the project.

User-First Design: Fast, convenient, and easy to use without sacrificing security.

How It Works

Local Encryption: All data stays on your device. Malware cannot access your passwords unless it can see your screen.

Password Management: Aegis generates strong, unique passwords automatically.

Offline First Design: Full functionality without an internet connection. Any sync options remain fully encrypted.

Zero Knowledge Architecture: Only you hold the keys to your data.

Development Philosophy

Development is led by Kayoki, prioritizing security, quality, and user-first design.

Contributors who make meaningful, high quality additions will be invited to a trusted developers’ circle.

The project is developed anonymously or under an alias to maintain focus on the users and security.

Who It’s For

Non-tech savvy users who want simple, strong cybersecurity.

Developers and privacy-conscious users seeking open-source, auditable tools.

Anyone looking for a fast, offline, secure, and free solution for password management and digital safety.
